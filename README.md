# NFL-Draft-Data

#Project Description: The intent of this project was to examine the NFL draft data from 2012 to 2017. Data points that were examined include: number of picks per team, what players (i.e.; positions) were most likely to get drafted, what schools and conferences sent the most players, and how much more likely a certain draft characteristic would be present if other characteristics in the draft pick were present. Packages used in this project include dplyr, arules, and ggplot.
